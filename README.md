ParallaxExperiments
===================

My attempt to create a fading ActionBar with Parallax Scrolling similar to what Manuel Peinado created [here](https://github.com/ManuelPeinado/FadingActionBar) based on a [popular blog post from Cyril Mottie](http://cyrilmottier.com/2013/05/24/pushing-the-actionbar-to-the-next-level/).

Why am I creating my own? Manuels solution did not work too well when resuming a fragment and I couldn't get it to work, so I started with a slightly different approach (still heavily based on Manuels work).

This is not a library and is probably never gonna be one. It's more likely I'll open a pull request for Manuels library eventually if this works and is compatible.
